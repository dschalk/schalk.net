    <p> "JS-monads-part1" begins the Javascript Monads series in earnest. The previous publications were exploratory in nature.</p>
    <p>  "JS-monads-part2 demonstrates the handling of numeric and string data provided by a Haskell web server. The monads run the data through successive computations guided by user interaction with the browser. Most of the api is available for experimentation in the browser console.</p>
    <p>  Like Websockets Monads Part 2, <a href="http://schalk.net:3093">Part 3</a> demonstrates guided iteration along a chain of monads, and also a tree with multiple branches. The centerpiece is "updateCalc", which controls the action in a dice game. The game is an expansion of the basic tree JS Monads Part 2. Quite a bit of functionality is handled with 31 lines of code. Click JS-monads-part3 for more information and a demonstration of the multi-player game.</p>
    <span> The game of Score features a Haskell Websockets server on the back end, and React.js on the front end. I did not use React.js as intended, and was on the verge of abandoning altogether. I found </span>
